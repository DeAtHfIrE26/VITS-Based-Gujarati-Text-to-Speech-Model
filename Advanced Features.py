Voice Conversion and Cloning

# Modify the model to accept speaker embeddings
# Use speaker verification models to extract embeddings

Emotional Speech Synthesis

# Define emotion labels
emotion_labels = ['neutral', 'happy', 'sad', 'angry']

# Modify the dataset to include emotion annotations
transcripts['emotion'] = 'neutral'  # Replace with actual emotion labels if available

# Update the model to accept emotion embeddings
# During training, include emotion information
def train_step(batch):
    emotion_ids = [emotion_labels.index(e) for e in batch['emotion']]
    emotion_ids = torch.LongTensor(emotion_ids).to(device)
    # Forward pass with emotion embeddings
    output = model(batch['input'], emotion_ids=emotion_ids)
